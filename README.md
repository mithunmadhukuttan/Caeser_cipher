# RSA Algorithm encryption
-RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission and encryption. It utilizes the mathematical properties of large prime numbers to create secure keys for encryption and decryption. RSA is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who introduced it in 1977. The strength of RSA lies in the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, which forms the basis of its security. It's commonly employed in various security protocols, including HTTPS for secure web browsing, digital signatures, and secure email communication.

# Deffie Hellmann
-The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. It's based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and is widely used in securing communications over the internet.
